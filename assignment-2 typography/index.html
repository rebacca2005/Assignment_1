          Baby, you can find me under the lights<br>
          Diamonds under my eyes<br>
          Turn the rhythm up, don't you wanna just<br>
          Come along for the ride?

          Ooh, my outfit so tight<br>
          You can see my heartbeat tonight<br>
          I can take the heat, baby, best believe<br>
          That's the moment I shine

          When the night's here, I don't do tears<br>
          Baby, no chance

          My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face<br>
          Watch me dance, dance the night away (Uh-huh)<br>
          I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place
